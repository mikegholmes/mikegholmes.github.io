        <h2>Picking Your First San Pedro Cactus</h2>

        <p>Tips on choosing a healthy plant.</p>
        <p>So, you want to bring a little bit of the desert indoors with a San Pedro cactus? Awesome! Here's what to look for when picking one out:

Healthy Glow: Your cactus should have a vibrant green color. No dull or yellowing parts!
Spiny but Fine: The spines should be short and evenly spaced. Avoid any that look overly spiky or have bald patches.
Plump and Firm: Give your cactus a gentle squeeze. It should feel firm, not squishy or wrinkled.
Size Matters: Pick a cactus that's the right size for your space. You don't want it to feel cramped or be too big for your pot.
With a little care, your San Pedro cactus will be a low-maintenance, cool addition to your home!</p>
