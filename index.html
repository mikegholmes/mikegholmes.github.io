  <h1>The Wonders of Plants</h1>

  <p>Plants are the foundation of life on Earth. They produce oxygen, provide food, and beautify our surroundings. From towering trees to tiny mosses, plants exhibit an incredible diversity of forms and functions.</p>


  <h2>Types of Plants</h2>

  <p>Plants can be broadly classified into two main groups: flowering plants and non-flowering plants. Flowering plants, such as roses and sunflowers, reproduce through flowers and seeds. Non-flowering plants, like ferns and mosses, reproduce through spores.</p>
