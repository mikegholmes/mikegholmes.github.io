      <h2>Picking Your First San Pedro</h2>
      <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <p>When choosing your first San Pedro cactus for indoor care, look for a healthy plant with vibrant green skin and no signs of rot or pests. Opt for a well-rooted cactus with a sturdy base. Remember these two key tips:

Bright, Indirect Light: Place your San Pedro in a spot that receives bright, indirect sunlight. A south-facing window is ideal. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can scorch the cactus.
Infrequent Watering: Overwatering is a common mistake. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. A good rule of thumb is to water your cactus deeply once every 2-3 weeks during the growing season and less frequently in winter.</p>

      <h2>Common San Pedro Problems</h2>
      <p>Common problems for San Pedro cacti include root rot, caused by overwatering, and pest infestations, particularly mealybugs and scale. To prevent root rot, ensure your cactus is planted in well-draining soil and avoid overwatering. For pest control, use a gentle insecticidal soap or neem oil to eliminate pests without harming the plant. Additionally, be mindful of fungal diseases that can appear as dark spots on the cactus. If you notice any signs of disease or pest infestation, isolate the affected plant and treat it promptly.</p>

      <h2>Fun Facts About San Pedro</h2>
      <p>San Pedro cacti are not only fascinating plants but also hold cultural and historical significance. Native to the Andes Mountains of South America, they have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and spiritual ceremonies by indigenous cultures. These cacti contain psychoactive compounds, primarily mescaline, which have been used for their hallucinogenic properties. However, it's important to note that the use of San Pedro cacti for recreational or medicinal purposes is subject to legal restrictions in many countries.</p>

      <h2>For Your Awareness</h2>
      <p San Pedro cactus can be dangerous to cats.

 1  While it's not immediately toxic, the spines can cause injury, and ingesting parts of the plant can lead to digestive issues and potential exposure to psychoactive substances.</p>
      <p>It's best to keep San Pedro cacti out of reach of curious pets. If a cat does ingest part of the plant, monitor them closely for any adverse reactions and consult with a veterinarian if necessary.</p>
